        <p><b>HTML</b> is short for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see on the Internet is written with HTML.</p>
        <p>HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, 	&lt;html&gt; is the opening tag and &lt;/html&gt; is the closing tag.</p>
